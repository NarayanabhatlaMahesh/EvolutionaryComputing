Conventional experience-driven design approaches exhibit fundamental limitations when confronting high-dimensional parameter spaces, complex multidisciplinary coupling effects, and dynamic performance prediction requirements, rendering trial-and-error iterative optimization processes inefficient and incapable of achieving optimal solutions. Intelligent design offers new pathways to overcome these limitations through the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) with traditional engineering workflows. However, the transition from theoretical concepts to manufacturing practice encounters three critical technical bottlenecks: the sparsity and heterogeneity of design data constrain the development of domain-specific large models, hallucination phenomena in generative design compromise solution trustworthiness, and numerical simulation methods face fundamental trade-offs between computational accuracy and efficiency. This paper conducts comprehensive analysis of the underlying causes of these challenges and proposes a knowledge-generation-simulation integrated intelligent design ecosystem as a development pathway. This approach achieves deep integration of large models with manufacturing domain knowledge, seamless fusion of AI with Computer-Aided Design/Computer-Aided Engineering (CAD/CAE) systems, and comprehensive synthesis of physics-based mechanisms with data-driven methods, driving the evolution of intelligent design from human-dominated iterative processes toward autonomous collaborative innovation systems, thereby providing robust support for technological breakthroughs in precision and extreme manufacturing equipment while facilitating the intelligent transformation of the manufacturing industry. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."

A narrative review synthesized 183 studies published between 2016 and 2025 that were located through PubMed, MDPI, Scopus, IEEE Xplore, and Web of Science. This review examines CVD diagnostics using innovative technologies such as digital cardiovascular twins, which involve the collection of data from wearable IoT devices (electrocardiography (ECG), photoplethysmography (PPG), and mechanocardiography), clinical records, laboratory biomarkers, and genetic markers, as well as their integration with artificial intelligence (AI), including machine learning and deep learning, graph and transformer networks for interpreting multi-dimensional data streams and creating prognostic models, as well as generative AI, medical large language models (LLMs), and autonomous agents for decision support, personalized alerts, and treatment scenario modeling, and with cloud and edge computing for data processing. This multi-layered architecture enables the detection of silent pathologies long before clinical manifestations, transforming continuous observations into actionable recommendations and shifting cardiology from reactive treatment to predictive and preventive care. Evidence converges on four layers: sensors streaming multimodal clinical and environmental data; hybrid analytics that integrate hemodynamic models with deep-, graph- and transformer learning while Bayesian and Kalman filters manage uncertainty; decision support delivered by domain-tuned medical LLMs and autonomous agents; and prospective simulations that trial pacing or pharmacotherapy before bedside use, closing the prediction-intervention loop. This stack flags silent pathology weeks in advance and steers proactive personalized prevention. It also lays the groundwork for software-as-a-medical-device ecosystems and new regulatory guidance for trustworthy AI-enabled cardiovascular care. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."

Yet, most existing research remains static or domain-specific, offering limited insight into the temporal and co-evolutionary dynamics of PDEs. To address this gap, this study adopts a theory-building approach to examine how PDEs evolve over time and to define a forward-looking research agenda. Drawing on empirical insights from five European countries, we investigate how key meta-characteristics and attributes of PDEs manifest, shift, and co-evolve in practice. Leveraging a recent multi-generational model as an analytical lens, we assess its alignment with real-world trajectories, identify overlooked and emerging features, and revise its structure accordingly. In doing so, we theorize PDE evolution as a multi-generational process shaped by institutional, technological, and contextual dynamics. This results in a refined model that better captures the complexity and diversity of PDE development, particularly considering emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), generative AI, and large language models (LLMs) shaping the forward-looking PDE generation. Building on these insights, we propose a future research agenda comprising 17 directions organized around revised meta-characteristics. This agenda supports the development of sustainable, resilient, and intelligent PDEs. The study contributes to the theorization of PDEs by offering an empirically grounded, temporally aware, and actionable roadmap for future research and policy design. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."

Environmental science, however, poses unique hurdles due to its interdisciplinary scope, specialized jargon, and heterogeneous data from climate dynamics to ecosystem management. Despite progress in subdomains like hydrology and climate modeling, no integrated framework exists to generate high-quality, domain-specific training data or evaluate LLM performance across the discipline. Here we introduce a unified pipeline to address this gap. It comprises EnvInstruct, a multi-agent system for prompt generation; ChatEnv, a balanced 100-million-token instruction dataset spanning five core themes (climate change, ecosystems, water resources, soil management, and renewable energy); and EnvBench, a 4998-item benchmark assessing analysis, reasoning, calculation, and description tasks. Applying this pipeline, we fine-tune an 8-billion-parameter model, EnvGPT, which achieves 92.06 ± 1.85 % accuracy on the independent EnviroExam benchmark—surpassing the parameter-matched LLaMA-3.1–8B baseline by ∼8 percentage points and rivaling the closed-source GPT-4o-mini and the 9-fold larger Qwen2.5–72B. On EnvBench, EnvGPT earns top LLM-assigned scores for relevance (4.87 ± 0.11), factuality (4.70 ± 0.15), completeness (4.38 ± 0.19), and style (4.85 ± 0.10), outperforming baselines in every category. This study reveals how targeted supervised fine-tuning on curated domain data can propel compact LLMs to state-of-the-art levels, bridging gaps in environmental applications. By openly releasing EnvGPT, ChatEnv, and EnvBench, our work establishes a reproducible foundation for accelerating LLM adoption in environmental research, policy, and practice, with potential extensions to multimodal and real-time tools. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."

A PRISMA-guided search of four databases retrieved 1358 records; after applying inclusion criteria, 143 peer-reviewed studies published between January 2019 and April 2025 were analyzed. This review shows that AI-driven controllers—especially deep-reinforcement-learning agents—deliver median energy savings of 18–35% for HVAC and other major loads, consistently outperforming rule-based and model-predictive baselines. The evidence further reveals a rapid diversification of methods: graph-neural-network models now capture spatial interdependencies in dense sensor grids, federated-learning pilots address data-privacy constraints, and early integrations of large language models hint at natural-language analytics and control interfaces for heterogeneous IoT devices. Yet large-scale deployment remains hindered by fragmented and proprietary datasets, unresolved privacy and cybersecurity risks associated with continuous IoT telemetry, the growing carbon and compute footprints of ever-larger models, and poor interoperability among legacy equipment and modern edge nodes. The authors of researches therefore converges on several priorities: open, high-fidelity benchmarks that marry multivariate IoT sensor data with standardized metadata and occupant feedback; energy-aware, edge-optimized architectures that lower latency and power draw; privacy-centric learning frameworks that satisfy tightening regulations; hybrid physics-informed and explainable models that shorten commissioning time; and digital-twin platforms enriched by language-model reasoning to translate raw telemetry into actionable insights for facility managers and end users. Addressing these gaps will be pivotal to transforming isolated pilots into ubiquitous, trustworthy, and human-centered IoT ecosystems capable of delivering measurable gains in efficiency, resilience, and occupant wellbeing at scale. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."

Their ability to process and generate human-like text has unlocked unprecedented opportunities across different domains such as healthcare, education, finance, and more. However, commercial LLM platforms face several limitations, including data privacy concerns, context size restrictions, lack of parameter configurability, and limited evaluation capabilities. These shortcomings hinder their effectiveness, particularly in scenarios involving sensitive information, large-scale document analysis, or the need for customized output. This underscores the need for a tool that combines the power of LLMs with enhanced privacy, flexibility, and usability. To address these challenges, we present EvidenceBot, a local, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based solution designed to overcome the limitations of commercial LLM platforms. EvidenceBot enables secure and efficient processing of large document sets through its privacy-preserving RAG pipeline, which extracts and appends only the most relevant text chunks as context for queries. The tool allows users to experiment with hyperparameter configurations, optimizing model responses for specific tasks, and includes an evaluation module to assess LLM performance against ground truths using semantic and similarity-based metrics. By offering enhanced privacy, customization, and evaluation capabilities, EvidenceBot bridges critical gaps in the LLM ecosystem, providing a versatile resource for individuals and organizations seeking to leverage LLMs effectively. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."

The forestry and grassland industry is characterized by vast geographical coverage, complex types, and high work difficulty. However, current professional models in this industry suffer from insufficient generality, adaptability, complex problem-solving capabilities, and collaborative decision-making abilities, making them unable to meet the industry's demands and restricting the high-quality development of the forestry and grassland industry. Therefore, it is imperative for the forest and grassland industry to deeply integrate artificial intelligence (AI) technologies represented by industry large models with forestry and grassland business operations to achieve innovative empowerment. This study aims to explore effective paths for constructing large models in the forestry and grassland industry, break through development bottlenecks, comprehensively enhance the informatization management level of the forestry and grassland industry, and promote the intelligent upgrade of the forestry and grassland industry.【 Method】 This paper elaborates on the current development status of large models, proposes the construction ideas of large models in the forestry and grassland industry, and constructs a framework for large models in the forestry and grassland industry covering infrastructure layer, data resource layer, model construction layer, and application service layer. Based on the characteristics of application scenarios in the forestry and grassland industry, it designs a technical system for large models in the forestry and grassland industry, including four types of large models: forestry and grassland large language models, forestry and grassland visual large models, forestry and grassland spatiotemporal large models, and forestry and grassland multimodal large models. Focusing on the development needs and trends of smart forestry and grassland and the application prospects of forestry and grassland intelligent agents, it deeply explores the application of large models in the forestry and grassland industry in eight typical scenarios, including forestry and grassland resource monitoring, forestry and grassland breeding and cultivation, forestry and grassland operation and management, forestry and grassland ecosystem management, forestry and grassland resource protection, forestry and grassland resource utilization, forestry and grassland ecological engineering, and forestry and grassland industry management. It also proposes innovative and integrated development ideas for large models in the forestry and grassland industry with cutting-edge technologies such as forestry and grassland real-scene 3D reconstruction, forestry and grassland digital twins, forestry and grassland embodied intelligence and forestry and grassland metaverse.【Result】 By constructing a forestry and grassland AI intelligent agent that integrates large models and professional models, the collaborative decision-making efficiency of large and small models in different business scenarios is strengthened, and the collaborative analysis and processing level of complex problems in the forestry and grassland industry is improved, providing professional, intelligent, and precise solutions covering the entire business chain for smart forestry and grassland.【Conclusion】Large models in the forestry and grassland industry are the core driving force for the construction of smart forestry and grassland and the intelligent engine for the development of forestry and grassland informatization. They can not only transform the research paradigm of forestry and grassland science but also reshape the industry management system. Moreover, they can inject core power into the development of new quality productivity in the forestry and grassland industry, provide strong support for scientific research, application, and industrial development in vertical fields of the entire smart forestry and grassland industry, and comprehensively promote the intelligent transformation of the forestry and grassland industry and the innovative application of AI industries, empowering the high-quality development of the forestry and grassland industry. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."

This paper presents a novel quantitative approach to shed light on the complex information dynamics arising from the growing use of generative AI tools. Despite their significant impact on the digital ecosystem, these dynamics remain largely uncharted and poorly understood. We propose a stochastic model to characterize the generation, indexing, and dissemination of information in response to new topics. This scenario particularly challenges current LLMs, which often rely on real-time Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques to overcome their static knowledge limitations. Our findings suggest that the rapid pace of generative AI adoption, combined with increasing user reliance, can outpace human verification, escalating the risk of inaccurate information proliferation across digital resources. An in-depth analysis of Stack Exchange data confirms that high-quality answers inevitably require substantial time and human effort to emerge.

However, while this paradigm enhances convenience, it disrupts the feedback-driven improvement loop that has historically powered the evolution of traditional Web search. Web search can continuously improve their ranking models by collecting large-scale, fine-grained user feedback (e.g., clicks, dwell time) at the document level. In contrast, generative AI search operates through a much longer search pipeline-spanning query decomposition, document retrieval, and answer generation-yet typically receives only coarse-grained feedback on the final answer. This introduces a feedback loop disconnect, where user feedback for the final output cannot be effectively mapped back to specific system components, making it difficult to improve each intermediate stage and sustain the feedback loop. To address this limitation, we envision NExT-Search, a next-generation paradigm designed to reintroduce fine-grained, process-level feedback into generative AI search. NExT-Search integrates two complementary modes: User Debug Mode, which allows engaged users to intervene at key stages-such as refining query decomposition, rating retrieved documents, and editing initial generated responses-and Shadow User Mode, where a personalized user agent simulates user preferences and provides AI-assisted feedback for less interactive users. As these feedback signals serve as valuable resources for refining the whole search pipeline, we also introduce a feedback store mechanism that encourages users to share and monetize their debugging efforts, further incentivizing participation. Furthermore, we envision how these feedback signals can be leveraged through online adaptation, which refines current search outputs in real-time, and offline update, which aggregates interaction logs to periodically fine-tune query decomposition, retrieval, and generation models. By restoring human control over key stages of the generative AI search pipeline, we believe NExT-Search offers a promising direction for building feedback-rich AI search systems that can evolve continuously alongside human feedback. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."

Representing multiple perspectives and expertise, the chatbots help students refine their causal models of climate change's impact on local marine ecosystems, communities and individuals. We first perform an empirical investigation leveraging participatory design to explore the values that motivate students and educators to engage with the chatbots. Then, we conceptualize the values that emerge from the empirical investigation by grounding them in research in ethical AI design, human values, human-AI interactions and environmental education. Findings illuminate considerations for the chatbots to support students' identity development, well-being, human–chatbot relationships and environmental sustainability. We further map the values onto design principles and illustrate how these principles can guide the development and evaluation of the chatbots.

By dynamically identifying and mitigating harmful, biased, or unethical outputs in real time, the system significantly enhances the safety and reliability of LLM-powered applications. This approach supports the responsible deployment of generative artificial intelligence (AI) technologies by ensuring adherence to ethical standards and regulatory frameworks while simultaneously preserving a high-quality user experience. This paper proposes a technological framework designed to mitigate the inherent risks associated with the deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) in decision-making and task execution within the management processes. The Agreement Validation Interface (AVI) functions as a modular Application Programming Interface (API) Gateway positioned between user applications and LLMs. This gateway architecture is designed to be LLM-agnostic, meaning it can operate with various underlying LLMs without requiring specific modifications for each model. This universality is achieved by standardizing the interface for requests and responses and applying a consistent set of validation and enhancement processes irrespective of the chosen LLM provider, thus offering a consistent governance layer across a diverse LLM ecosystem. AVI facilitates the orchestration of multiple AI subcomponents for input–output validation, response evaluation, and contextual reasoning, thereby enabling real-time, bidirectional filtering of user interactions. A proof-of-concept (PoC) implementation of AVI was developed and rigorously evaluated using industry-standard benchmarks. The system was tested for its effectiveness in mitigating adversarial prompts, reducing toxic outputs, detecting personally identifiable information (PII), and enhancing factual consistency. The results demonstrated that AVI reduced successful fast injection attacks by 82%, decreased toxic content generation by 75%, and achieved high PII detection performance (F1-score ≈ 0.95). Furthermore, the contextual reasoning module significantly improved the neutrality and factual validity of model outputs.

Urban greening, as a dynamic process, requires citizen engagement to integrate their lived experiences. The value co-creation approach offers a promising framework to facilitate citizen involvement in shaping urban green spaces. Without successful translation of these experiences into tangible value during the implementation phase, co-creation efforts may revert to mere participatory practices in which citizen involvement is superficial. Since Large Language Models (LLMs) have the potential to streamline user feedback, this study examines whether LLMs can enhance citizen engagement in the co-creation of value for urban greening. Using a survey experiment designed to prompt participation in urban greening initiatives, this study found that the demo of LLM significantly increases citizens' participation at initial stage and their engagement in co-creating value in use. The mechanism analysis identified that the demo of LLMs increases citizen engagement by reducing participation barriers. However, interaction effect analysis reveals a decrease in engagement and enthusiasm among citizens with higher self-efficacy when LLMs are applied. The findings of this study suggest that LLMs can be viable tools in facilitating urban greening initiatives under a co-creation framework. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."

Biased LLMs' decisions and misinformation undermine democratic processes, and existing trust models fail to address the intricacies of trust in LLMs. Currently, oversimplified, one-directional approaches have largely overlooked the many relationships between trustor (user) contextual factors (e.g. ideology, perceptions) and trustee (LLMs) systemic elements (e.g. scientists, tool's features). In this work, we introduce a bowtie model for holistically conceptualizing and formulating trust in LLMs, with a core component comprehensively exploring trust by tying its two sides, namely the trustor and the trustee, as well as their intricate relationships. We uncover these relationships within the proposed bowtie model and beyond to its sociotechnical ecosystem, through a mixed-methods explanatory study, that exploits a political discourse analysis tool (integrating ChatGPT), by exploring and responding to the next critical questions: 1) How do trustor's contextual factors influence trust-related actions? 2) How do these factors influence and interact with trustee systemic elements? 3) How does trust itself vary across trustee systemic elements? Our bowtie-based explanatory analysis reveals that past experiences and familiarity significantly shape trustor's trust-related actions; not all trustor contextual factors equally influence trustee systemic elements; and trustee's human-in-The-loop features enhance trust, while lack of transparency decreases it. Finally, this solid evidence is exploited to deliver recommendations, insights and pathways towards building robust trusting ecosystems in LLM-based solutions. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."

Social media texts from the Lushan Scenic Area, known for its rich cultural ecosystem services, were analyzed. The methodology involved adapting the model using few-shot learning to classify cultural ecosystem services and associated sentiments. Prompts were specifically designed to optimize model performance. The validation process compared the performance of three base models (GLM-4-0520, ERNIE-4.0-8K, and Moonshot-v1-8k) alongside five prompts. The cultural ecosystem services within the study area were subsequently analyzed based on model outputs. The findings indicated superior performance by the Moonshot-v1-8k model, achieving 82.2 % micro-F1 and 80.3 % macro-F1. The implementation of chain-of-thought prompts and cultural ecosystem services definition prompts enhanced micro-F1 and macro-F1 by up to 6.3 % and 3.3 %, respectively. Within the Lushan Scenic Area, aesthetic services were identified as the most frequently perceived, while recreational services received the most negative sentiments. A marked increase in public interest in physical health was observed following the COVID-19 pandemic.

While prior studies have emphasized strategic benefits and readiness models, there remains a lack of operational guidance tailored to SME realities—particularly regarding implementation barriers, resource constraints, and emerging demands for responsible AI use. This study presents an analysis of AI adoption in SMEs by integrating the technology–organization–environment (TOE) framework with selected attributes from the diffusion of innovations (DOI) theory to examine adoption dynamics through a dual structural and perceptual lens. Empirical insights from sectoral and regional contexts are also incorporated. Ten critical challenges are identified and analyzed across the TOE dimensions, ranging from data access and skill shortages to cultural resistance, infrastructure limitations, and weak governance practices. Notably, the framework is expanded to incorporate responsible AI governance and democratized access to generative AI—particularly open-weight large language models (LLMs) such as LLaMA, DeepSeek-R1, Mistral, and FALCON—as emerging technological and ethical imperatives. Each challenge is paired with actionable, context-sensitive solutions. The paper is a structured, literature-based conceptual analysis enriched by empirical case study insights. As a key contribution, it introduces a structured, six-phase roadmap methodology to guide SMEs through AI adoption—offering step-by-step recommendations aligned with technological, organizational, and strategic readiness. While this roadmap is conceptual and has yet to be validated through field data, it sets a foundation for future diagnostic tools and practical assessments. The resulting study bridges theoretical insight and implementation strategy—empowering inclusive, responsible, and scalable AI transformation in SMEs. By offering both analytical clarity and practical relevance, this study contributes to a more grounded understanding of AI integration and calls for policies, ecosystems, and leadership models that support SMEs in adopting AI not merely as a tool, but as a strategic enabler of sustainable and inclusive innovation. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."

Through several research projects, the team investigate the divergence between DTs and Metaverses through the lens of their purpose, data structure, immersion, and interactivity, while highlighting areas of convergence driven by emerging technologies in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Extended Reality (XR).This study aims to investigate the convergence of DTs and the Metaverse in digital architecture, examining how emerging technologies—such as AI, XR, and Large Language Models (LLMs)—are blurring their traditional boundaries. By analyzing their divergent purposes, data structures, and interactivity modes, as well as hybrid applications (e.g., data-integrated virtual environments and AI-driven collaboration), this study seeks to define the opportunities and challenges of this integration for architectural design, decision-making, and immersive user experiences. Our research spans multiple projects utilizing XR and AI to develop DT and the Metaverse. The team assess the capabilities of AI in DT environments, such as reality capture and smart building management. Concurrently, the team evaluates metaverse platforms for online collaboration and architectural education, focusing on features facilitating multi-user engagement. The paper presents evaluations of various virtual environment development pipelines, comparing traditional BIM+IoT workflows with novel approaches such as Gaussian Splatting and generative AI for content creation. The team further explores the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) in both domains, such as virtual agents or LLM-powered Non-Player-Controlled Characters (NPC), enabling autonomous interaction and enhancing user engagement within spatial environments. Finally, the paper argues that DTs and Metaverse’s once-distinct boundaries are becoming increasingly porous. Hybrid digital spaces—such as virtual buildings with data-integrated twins and immersive, social metaverses—demonstrate this convergence.

According to recent research, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated immense potential in smart contract security audits but still lack the capability for effective vulnerability detection. Consequently, leveraging the capabilities of LLMs to effectively enhance the performance of smart contract vulnerability detection remains a critical challenge. In this paper, we propose Agent4Vul, a novel framework utilizing multimodal LLM agents to enhance smart contract vulnerability detection. Specifically, we design two LLM-based agents: Commentator and Vectorizer. The Commentator agent generates comments for the source code, while the Vectorizer agent converts contents into vector representations. Subsequently, we develop a multimodal learning architecture comprising the semantic branch and the graph branch, which collectively integrate features from the source code, generated comments, and the bytecode control flow graph (CFG). We empirically evaluate a large-scale real dataset of smart contracts and compare 19 state-of-the-art baseline approaches.

As biodiversity loss continues to pose a major challenge for humankind, it necessitates a re-evaluation of these biases to support the protection of biodiversity as a whole. With large language model (LLM) chatbots becoming increasingly integrated into daily life for information dissemination and education purposes, understanding their inherent biases is vital. In this study, we tested 10 popular Western LLM chatbots using simple prompts to assess how they portray bees and wasps. Butterflies, moths, flies, and mosquitoes were also included for comparison to evaluate broader societal perceptions. Our results show that bees and butterflies are indeed depicted positively by the LLM chatbots and moths somewhat positively, while wasps, flies, and mosquitoes are associated with more negative portrayals. We found that LLMs mirror prevailing human biases toward different insect groups and their perceived importance in nature conservation. Moreover, we demonstrate that LLM chatbots tend to oversimplify insect diversity by predominantly restricting “bees” to honeybees and “wasps” to yellowjackets, thereby neglecting the broader biodiversity that includes wild bees and parasitoid wasps. The chatbots also appeared to favor Nearctic species when recommending conservation priorities. By highlighting these biases and discussing their implications, our research underscores the importance of nuanced science communication and expert involvement in decision-making for nature conservation. Addressing such biases is essential to prevent the reinforcement of public misconceptions and to promote the protection of ecologically indispensable yet less popular insect groups. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."

Using Microsoft's Copilot, we conducted a comparative analysis by prompting election news in five languages: English, Traditional Chinese, Simplified Chinese, German, and Swedish. While Copilot uses mainly professional news media, provides quick access to synthesized information, and exhibits source transparency, it frequently creates misinformation and misattributes news sources. The analysis highlights variations in Copilot's sourcing behavior, showing a strong reliance on English-language sources, particularly those from the UK and US, across different prompting languages. Such reliance raises concerns about the homogenization of information and the marginalization of regional perspectives. The study underscores the critical role and dilemma of news media, which, while serving as authoritative sources in democratic societies, must navigate an increasing AI-mediated information ecosystem to maintain autonomy vis-à-vis powerful technological infrastructures. By evaluating Copilot's sourcing practices and misinformation prevalence, this research contributes to the discourse on AI's impact on news dissemination, media diversity, and democratic processes. Specifically, we discuss the consequences of two approaches available to news media to prevent their content from being used without compensation: opting out of crawling (“platform counterbalancing”) or establishing partnerships with AI companies. Current regulatory efforts, including copyright reforms and the EU AI Act, fall short of safeguarding journalism or regulating AI. We propose policy and regulatory recommendations to improve transparency, factual correctness, accuracy in source attribution, and accountability in AI-generated content, supporting informed citizenship in the digital age. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."

Understanding the interdisciplinary nature of Agents will help library science, information science and other related disciplines to better design and apply AI technologies and achieve the core mission of connecting humans and knowledge in a more efficient, accurate and humane way. It will also enable library science to more accurately integrate the essence of the six major disciplines and transform the traditional three-subject relationship of readers, librarians and systems into a new collaborative paradigm. [Method/Process] Using interdisciplinary literature analysis, the definition, theoretical evolution and application characteristics of Agent in six major disciplines of philosophy, economics, law, biology, sociology and computer science are sorted out, the concepts and theories related to Agent contained in library science are explored, and the commonalities and differentiation of Agent in the five-dimensional characteristics of autonomy, perception, purpose, adaptability and interactivity of each discipline are compared. The theoretical essence of the six major disciplines is mapped to the three-dimensional subject in the practical field of library science, and the Agent role coordination mechanism of readers, librarians and systems is analyzed. Readers are entities with intentions and autonomous consciousness, and they will actively initiate information search behaviors based on information needs such as learning knowledge and solving problems and will also adjust their strategies according to environmental changes such as technical tools and social culture, reflecting agent-like adaptability. Librarians serve as service intermediaries and information gatekeepers, connecting readers with resources through technical services such as classification and cataloging, and helping users clarify their information needs and improve their information literacy through reader services such as reference consultation. The library's information systems will also simulate human agent capabilities through algorithms or technologies. Automated search engines or crawlers will collect data according to preset rules, and personalized information recommendations will be made based on user behavior, driving the library's management and services towards automation and intelligence. [Results/Conclusions] The commonality of interdisciplinary agents revolves around the realization of goals by autonomous actors in the environment. The five-dimensional characteristics constitute an interdisciplinary consensus, and the differences are due to the core issues of the disciplines. The essence of a library is a multi-agent system. The reader agent integrates philosophical intentionality and economic game strategy, reflecting demand-driven adaptive retrieval. The librarian agent inherits the legal agency rights and responsibilities and the sociological structural initiative, becoming a professional intermediary between resources and users. The system agent draws on the biological evolutionary adaptation and computer perception closed loop, and advances to an intelligent base for autonomous optimization. AI Agent is a technical enhancement of the inherent agent characteristics of library science. It realizes automation, personalization and intelligent service upgrades through large language models, realizes intention understanding, tool calling, and multi-agent collaboration, and drives the three-element subject from passive response to active collaboration. The three-element agent framework for library science is created, which clarifies the collaborative agent roles of readers, librarians, and systems, and reveals the deep logic of AI Agent driven by large language models and library science. An interdisciplinary comparative study of the Agent concepts reveals that its essence is a practical vehicle for achieving autonomous decision-making in a specific environment. Philosophy gives it depth of consciousness, economics models strategic games, law defines the boundaries of rights and responsibilities, biology reveals evolutionary logic, sociology anchors structural interactions, and computer science ultimately achieves a closed-loop technology.

As an integral part of smart city infrastructure and advanced air mobility systems, LAIN contributes both to economic growth and to airspace security. By integrating unmanned aerial vehicles, fifth-generation communication technologies, and artificial intelligence, LAIN enables real-time monitoring and provides services for urban traffic, agriculture, and disaster management. This integration optimizes resource allocation and enhances public safety. However, the rapid development of LAIN results in a vast array of distributed aircraft and ground equipment that generate large volumes of heterogeneous data in various formats. The absence of a unified representation standard significantly hinders the efficient utilization of data within the LAIN ecosystem, presenting substantial challenges for its widespread application in complex real-world scenarios. Therefore, the development of a unified data representation model for multi-dimensional and heterogeneous information within LAIN is essential to eliminate data heterogeneity, enhance data utilization efficiency, and promote the deep integration of the low-altitude economy with the digital economy. Process Existing research has explored innovative methods and technologies for information representation and addressing potential challenges in the LAIN. However, current solutions remain domain-specific and lack adaptability to the dynamic environment of LAIN. The absence of targeted research and standards makes it difficult to establish a unified representation for multi-source data. To bridge this gap, a heterogeneous information unified representation model is proposed for LAIN. This paper aims to address the challenges posed by complex data and information in the LAIN environment, particularly within the context of the sixth generation of communication technologies, and to provide new approaches for data management and application in LAIN. First, the heterogeneous data types within LAIN are categorized, highlighting their key characteristics and application scenarios. A platform for LAIN data integration and fusion is then developed, incorporating multiple technologies to facilitate efficient data collection, transmission, processing, and visual display. Additionally, the challenges of achieving a unified representation of multi-dimensional and heterogeneous information within LAIN are analyzed. Finally, promising methods for data fusion and representation are discussed, including data fusion, spatiotemporal gridding data technology, multi-mode technology, and knowledge graphs. These methods aim to establish a unified knowledge representation model and achieve semantic alignment, enabling the integration of data from diverse sources. Specifically, multi-source data are preprocessed to enhance understandability and availability through multi-level fusion, integrating multi-dimensional information from various sensors and data sources within a unified framework. Spatiotemporal gridding standardizes data formats and captures spatiotemporal changes, thereby effectively processing and integrating multi-source, multi-dimensional spatial data. Furthermore, integrating multi-mode data through multi-mode technology is expected to improve decision-making accuracy, while the knowledge graph links multi-source data, constructing a knowledge network that standardizes and correlates information from various sources, formats, and semantics. Prospects With the advancement of multi-dimensional data unified representation technology, the LAIN is poised to integrate with edge computing, radio knowledge description languages, large language models, and other emerging technologies to enable intelligent analysis and autonomous decision-making for low-altitude systems. Specifically, data processing can be optimized through edge computing. By positioning edge devices closer to the terminal, edge computing facilitates preprocessing and preliminary analysis at the data source. This technology enhances response speed and efficiency, providing high-quality services for the rapid acquisition and unified representation of LAIN information. Data from various sensors and systems can be structured and represented in an organized manner, facilitating data exchange between different systems, enabling readable spectrum management policies, and reducing interference incidents. Additionally, large language models can assist in constructing and refining knowledge graphs, advancing the intelligent operation and management of low-altitude aircraft. These promising technologies are expected to support further fusion and unified representation of LAIN data, laying a foundation for future research in the LAIN field.

While existing research predominantly focuses on isolated applications of intelligent technologies, systematic evaluations of the synergistic effects of technological integration on maritime ecosystems, policy compatibility, and contributions to global carbon emission governance remain under-explored. Leveraging bibliometric analysis, this study systematically examines 488 publications from the Web of Science (WoS) Core Collection (2000–2024), yielding three pivotal findings: firstly, China dominates the research landscape, with a 38.5% contribution share, where Artificial Intelligence (AI), the Internet of Things (IoT), and port automation constitute the technological pillars. However, critical gaps persist in cross-system protocol standardization and climate-adaptive modeling, accounting for only 2.7% and 4.2% of the literature, respectively. Secondly, international collaboration networks exhibit pronounced “Islamization”, characterized by an inter-team collaboration rate of 17.3%, while the misalignment between rapid technological iteration and existing maritime regulations exacerbates industry risks. Thirdly, a dual-track pathway integrating Cyber–Physical System (CPS)-based digital twin ports and open-source vertical domain-specific large language models is proposed. Empirical evidence demonstrates its efficacy in reducing cargo-handling energy consumption by 15% and decision-making latency by 40%. This research proposes a novel tripartite framework, encompassing technological, institutional, and data sovereignty dimensions, to resolve critical challenges in integrating multi-source maritime data and managing cross-border governance. The model provides academically validated and industry-compatible strategies for advancing sustainable maritime intelligence.

Most service research centers on the division between human and AI resources. Less attention has been paid to analyzing the entangled resource relations and interactions between humans and AI entities. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to extend our metatheoretical understanding of resource integration and value cocreation by analyzing different human–AI resource relations in service ecosystems. Design/methodology/approach: The conceptual paper adapts a novel framework from postphenomenology, specifically cyborg intentionality. This framework is used to analyze what kinds of human–AI resource relations enable resource integration and value cocreation in service ecosystems. Findings: We conceptualize seven different human–AI resource relations, namely background, embodiment, hermeneutic, alterity, cyborg, immersion and composite relation. The sociotechnical entangled perspective on human–AI resource relations challenges and reframes our understanding of interactions between humans and nonhumans in resource integration and value cocreation and the distinction between operant and operand resources in service research. Originality/value: Our primary contribution to researchers and service providers is dissolving the distinction between operant and operand resources. We present two foundational propositions. 1. Humans and AI become entangled value cocreating resources in inherently sociotechnical service ecosystems; and 2.

They are expected to become disruptive display technology following liquid crystal display (LCD) and organic light emitting diode (OLED), especially in fields like micro-projection, near-eye displays, and others. However, these fields urgently require display devices with high light efficiency and good directivity. The light extraction efficiency and beam shaping of Micro-LEDs have become pressing challenges for researchers and industry. Light extraction technologies, such as Micro-LED sidewall repair, surface random roughening, and surface photonic crystal technology, have been developed. For beam shaping, there are Micro-LED beam modulation designs based on structures like microlenses, metasurfaces, and resonant cavities. Due to these technologies, Micro-LEDs can be effectively used in near-eye display applications. Progress In this study, we have reviewed and analyzed many Micro-LED-related design solutions. We summarize the advantages and disadvantages of these options and discuss aspects related to manufacturing design, process costs, material selection, etc. Through comparison, it can be concluded that photonic crystal technology is effective in improving the light extraction efficiency of Micro-LEDs. However, there are some drawbacks, such as difficulty in obtaining a directional light source, the challenges of manufacturing photonic crystals, and the high production costs. Microlens technology performs well in light field control, but its effect on Micro-LED light extraction efficiency is not significant. Metasurface technology presents high processing difficulty and costs, but it offers significant beam-shaping effects. Resonant cavity structures can effectively enhance light extraction efficiency and achieve precise beam shaping in Micro-LEDs. However, their implementation faces substantial challenges in fabrication process and structural design complexity. Sidewall repair and rough surface technologies are more effective in improving Micro-LED light extraction efficiency. These classic examples help us better understand and study Micro-LED technology. Conclusions and Prospects With the development of Micro-LED technology, we believe that costs will be reduced soon. Micro-LED development is expected to usher in a breakthrough. Surface roughening and sidewall passivation technologies also have room for improvement. The Micro-lens array is easier to realize at the process level. Metasurface technology, photonic crystal technology, micro-cavity structures, and other research areas are experiencing a development boom. In the application of Micro-LED displays, they can be combined with artificial intelligence (AI) technology. We can use AI algorithms to design and optimize structures. Additionally, AI can improve accuracy and reduce labor costs, to realize the application of “AI+ Micro-LED Display”. AI algorithms can automatically identify and repair wafer defects in Micro-LED manufacturing. They can also analyze chip position deviations during mass transfer and adjust process parameters in real-time to improve yields. In terms of user demand analysis, AI optimizes color calibration, brightness adjustment, and other parameters of Micro-LED displays to enhance the immersive experience of AR/VR devices. In the field of visible light communication integration, “AI+ Micro-LED Display” can simultaneously realize display and high-speed optical communication functions, such as pulse-width modulation. The in-depth application of AI technology provides more possibilities for Micro-LED display products. Through natural language processing technology, users can interact more intelligently with devices using voice commands. However, there are also challenges to the adaptability of AI technology. AI model training requires a large amount of manufacturing data, but the lack of a data-sharing mechanism between enterprises limits the universality of the algorithm. Additionally, the technical standards for Micro-LED combined with AI have not been unified, which may lead to compatibility issues and a lack of mature software. Hardware ecosystems may also limit the expansion of application scenarios. In addition, quantum dot materials offer high color purity and saturation, which makes them highly suitable for Micro-display applications. Micro-LED light extraction and beam shaping technologies can be combined with quantum dots and other innovations to achieve high-efficiency, full-color displays. As research progresses, we believe that these technical challenges can be overcome, thus paving the way for the more widespread market adoption of Micro-LED technology. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."

Since 2017, neural machine translation (NMT) systems such as DeepL and, subsequently, large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT have been drastically changing, if not revolutionizing, the language industry. LLMs have larger context windows than NMT systems and allow for translations to be adapted to various reception situations. For instance, a text can be simultaneously translated and stylistically raised or lowered, and its literary form can be adapted in the target language. LLMs can also be useful for translating neologisms and other playful or creative textual elements. Despite the advantages of AI-based translation processes, some AI critics want literary translation to remain the sole preserve of humans. They speak of the impending destruction of the literary industry, a sensitive ecosystem, or of human creativity being connected to the desire to answer profound questions, which only humans are capable of, in the process of intellectual debate. Taking account of these conflicting positions, this contribution suggests that artificial intelligence can only transform literary translation in a sustainable way if humans are placed at the center of translation-relevant technological advancements. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."

Then, we discuss emerging solutions that demonstrate the effectiveness of GAI in addressing various challenges of blockchain, such as detecting unknown blockchain attacks and smart contract vulnerabilities, designing key secret sharing schemes, and enhancing privacy. Moreover, we present a case study to demonstrate that GAI, specifically the generative diffusion model, can be employed to optimize blockchain network performance metrics. Experimental results clearly show that, compared to a baseline traditional AI approach, the proposed generative diffusion model approach can converge faster, achieve higher rewards, and significantly improve the throughput and latency of the blockchain network. Additionally, we highlight future research directions for GAI in blockchain applications, including personalized GAI-enabled blockchains, GAI-blockchain synergy, and privacy and security considerations within blockchain ecosystems. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."

However, these models face knowledge cutoffs and costly updates, driving a new ecosystem for LLM-based applications that leverage interaction techniques to extend capabilities and facilitate knowledge updates. As these models grow more complex, understanding their internal workings becomes increasingly challenging, posing significant issues for transparency, interpretability, and explainability. This paper proposes a novel approach to interpretability by shifting the focus to understanding the model’s functionality within specific contexts through interaction techniques. Rather than dissecting the LLM itself, we explore how contextual information and interaction techniques can elucidate the model’s thought processes. To this end, we introduce the Context-Driven Divergent Knowledge Evaluation (CDK-E) methodology, along with the Divergent Knowledge Dataset (DKD), for evaluating the interpretability of LLMs in context-specific scenarios that diverge from the model’s inherent knowledge. The empirical results demonstrate that advanced LLMs achieve high alignment with divergent contexts, validating our hypothesis that contextual information significantly enhances interpretability. Moreover, the strong correlation between LLM-based metrics and semantic metrics confirms the reliability of our evaluation framework. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."

Special mechanisms to evaluate large language models and their uses are needed. Approaches are necessary to balance the needs of the entire spectrum of health ecosystem interests, from large firms to start-ups. The evaluation and regulatory system will need to focus on patient health outcomes to balance the use of AI for financial optimization for developers, payers, and health systems. Conclusions and Relevance: Strong oversight by the FDA protects the long-term success of industries by focusing on evaluation to advance regulated technologies that improve health. The FDA will continue to play a central role in ensuring safe, effective, and trustworthy AI tools to improve the lives of patients and clinicians alike.

Over the decades since the concept of Artificial Intelligence (AI) was initiated, AI has witnessed waves of development, from early attempts to create human-like conversational agents to the recent surge in deep learning and big data. The 21st century has seen remarkable breakthroughs, with applications spanning various industries, including technology, healthcare, and education. Efforts to address AIś impact on society are evident in the development of ethical guidelines and regulations. Countries and regions around the world are working on refining legal frameworks for AI. While research and technology advancements are rapid, the commercialization of AI encounters persistent barriers. Despite significant progress, ethical debates concerning AIś interaction with human society are still heated, and AI applications also grapple with unresolved issues in pertinent scenarios. For the technological innovation problem, large language models, such as those based on the Transformer architecture, highlight the struggle for efficient data utilization and the associated cost of developing advanced algorithms. For the commercialization practice, the burst of the AI investment bubble and discussions about AI potentially replacing traditional labor further complicate the industryś trajectory. As the AI industrial ecosystem evolves, there is a need for coordinated solutions and the development of comprehensive industry standards to propel the AI industry toward sustained and healthy growth. This paper concludes significant hurdles as follows: Firstly, there is a misalignment between AI model demands and industry integration, resulting in a talent gap and high commercialization costs. Secondly, there is a structural imbalance in talent supply and demand, with a shortage of high-quality AI professionals. Lastly, on the supply side of AI models, technical bottlenecks and limitations are hindering broad applications. Additionally, the lack of well-established ethical standards and industry norms globally poses challenges in governance, impacting the acceptance and effective utilization of AI applications. The journey of AI from its conceptualization to the present day reflects a continuous struggle between technological advancements and the complexities of societal integration. The "" i7C"" framework, which integrates seven key elements: data for computing, computing arithmetic, computing power, computing knowledge, computing scenario, computing talents, and ethics in computing, is proposed to address these obstacles. The "" i7C"" framework builds a robust AI infrastructure with hardware capabilities such as data for computing, computing arithmetic, and computing power. With computing knowledge and scenarios, it promotes the commercial application of AI technologies. Besides, it systematically cultivates computing talents, fully implements industry application standards, actively responds to ethical concerns in society, and forms a strong cultural bond to drive collaborative and mutually beneficial efforts among all members of the ecosystem. Thus, the AI industry ecosystem achieves sustainable development. To achieve the sustainable development of the AI business ecosystem, core enterprises in the AI industry ecosystem should collaborate with leading partners to collectively build AI infrastructure, drive the commercial application of AI technologies, and together foster a sustainable cultural bond to attract and stimulate more AI ecosystem partners. The AI industry faces challenges in implementation, unclear regulations, and a costly, low - sharing environment. To address this, the “i7C” framework is essential for AI to integrate seamlessly and empower diverse industries. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."

Accordingly, these learning objectives are identified:▪ to frame a data and insights-driven design challenge and communicate product and solution design ideas clearly (LO 1);▪ to understand and apply the design thinking process for data science and AI-enabled digital product ecosystem innovation (LO 2);▪ to deploy a structured methodology for adapting a data science and AI-enabled digital product ecosystem in diverse markets (LO 3); and▪ to create a digital product management and go-to-market roadmap for tapping new markets (LO 4). Case overview/synopsis: Stones2Milestones (S2M), a pioneering Indian EdTech company founded in 2009, is preparing to script a first-of-its-kind global success story with Freadom, its machine learning and artificial intelligence-enabled English learning product suite, being used by over 7,500 schools and 1 million-plus K-12 students. Driven by the mission of creating a nation of readers and helping every child “find their place in the world”, the bootstrapped social venture struggled to sustain itself in the initial years despite a healthy uptake by schools of its evocatively named offering, Wings of Words (WOW) that aimed to inculcate the habit of reading among 3–12-year-olds through storytelling. In 2016, S2M pivoted to a product-based model led by technology and digital innovations, launching Freadom, an adaptive mobile reading app that logged an exponential growth in its user base. By 2019, Freadom’s remarkable vision, a data science-led product map, and its enormous potential for global socio-economic impact had earned it a serendipitous association with Stanford University as a mentor and collaborator. Over the next four years, S2M’s contrarian bet on a data science and analytics-led product development strategy, an obsessive focus on user-centric continuous product innovation, foresight to translate the Covid-19 pandemic crisis into an opportunity, and strategic impetus to leverage the Stanford association led to 20-fold growth in its user base, sustained commercial success and global recognition. Enthused by Freadom’s growing success and its untapped global potential in transforming English language skill-acquisition as an essential life-skill among learners in 110-plus English-as-second-language (ESL) countries, the S2M product team had christened Freadom as the “English OS for the World.” In November 2023, in pursuit of ambitious global aspirations, S2M entered into a partnership with the Finnish Global Education Solutions (FGES), a member of Education Finland program controlled by the Finnish National Agency for Education. The S2M-FGES joint venture, by leveraging the mutually complementary strengths of the two partners – a market-leading data science and AI-based product suite with the Stanford pedigree, user-centric innovation expertise, an established and loyal customer base, easy access to low-cost tech and data science talent, sales and distribution capabilities and the global stature of the renowned Finnish school education system that could open doors – aims to further develop and deploy Freadom on the international stage. The case introduces Freadom at this pivotal juncture, identifying underlying dilemmas and challenges that must be addressed towards realizing its global potential. How could Freadom’s ambition fructify, of establishing a made-in-India English learning product suite as the “English OS for the world” in mature global ESL markets, an audacious dream that had never been attempted before? Would the product development, customer acquisition and market expansion approaches aimed at “creating a nation of readers” that had worked so well in India, be replicable in diverse K-12 learning landscapes such as South Korea, Singapore, Middle East and Finland, that were very different, each of them unique in its own way – in socio-cultural, linguistic, educational and pedagogical environment? And, how could Freadom continue to deliver on its promise of being the ultimate English learning platform for 3–12-year-old K-12 students globally, helping them find “their place in the world?” Complexity academic level: This case can be used in courses or modules on data science and AI-based solutioning, design thinking and communication, user-centric problem-solving, creativity, innovation, social entrepreneurship, new product planning and development, digital product management, customer experience (Cx) management, sustainable development and international business. The case focuses on the contemporary theme of data science and AI-based design thinking as a tool to understand and frame a socially-pertinent need gap and design challenge, communicate and evaluate ideas and drive sustained user-centric innovation in a digital ecosystem. The surrounding context of this case pertains to social and impact entrepreneurship in an emerging economy with high socio-economic disparities, and underscores the potential for grassroots digital innovations originating from emerging markets to address societal and human development need gaps globally, including in developed economies. This case, therefore, presents a unique opportunity to the faculty at global business schools, which have a fairly diverse class mix from developed and large emerging economies, to generate an enriching discussion on the multifaceted potential of “border-less” social entrepreneurship and innovation.

This is significant, particularly in this era of climate emergency and ongoing threats to planetary energy and water supplies. The vocabulary attached to AI often aims to mimic positive human capacities such as “warmness” and “care.” However, these attempts to humanize AI and digital technology come with an anthropocentric gaze and blind spots that bracket out the environmental impacts and footprints of AI and privilege humans and technology over nonhuman animals and planetary ecological limits.

Analogously, GenAI is a form of artificial intelligence which learns from massive datasets to generate new data, showcasing human-like creativity in text, images to code, speech, and video. Two critical pillars of the GenAI technology are large language models (LLMs) and vector data. In particular, LLMs are a category of genAI models that emphasize on generating new text contents. On the other hand, there is also an upsurge of dense, high-dimensional, billion-scale vector data from deep learning models that embed complex data, e.g., text, multimedia, graphs, and tables into vector representations aiming to preserve semantic similarity. Since LLMs operate on vector data at various stages consisting of pre-training, fine-tuning, inference, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), coupling large language models with vector data management is essential for enhancing data science services with cross-modal data querying and generation. It creates new opportunities and challenges in areas such as accuracy, consistency, efficiency, scalability, privacy, fairness, explainability, data regulations, software-hardware collaboration, and cloud-native systems.

It systematically reviews the historical development and theoretical foundations of multimodal learning technologies while emphasizing their relevance to intelligent library ecosystems. The analysis is organized around key application areas, including intelligent navigation, intelligent question and answer systems, user education with intelligent support, and immersive reading experiences. These areas were explored through a combination of case studies, and a detailed analysis of current library practices. To evaluate the practical impact of these technologies, the study employed qualitative methods, analyzing user feedback and system performance metrics. This comprehensive research also identifies current barriers to adoption, such as data privacy concerns, technology costs, and disparities in user acceptance across different demographics. [Results/Conclusions] The results show that multimodal learning technologies significantly enhance the functionality and user experience of smart libraries.

This scaling behavior has fueled intense competition in generative AI, supported by projected investments that exceed $1 trillion to develop increasingly sophisticated LLMs. This competition has in turn nurtured a vibrant ecosystem, inspiring new open-source models such as DeepSeek, and motivating application developers to harness state-of-the-art LLMs for real-world deployments. However, the extensive memory and computational requirements of large models present serious obstacles for small-medium organizations, leading to significant scalability concerns. This paper offers a comprehensive review of recent techniques to improve LLM efficiency through four categories: parameter-centric, architecture-centric, training-centric and data-centric. For a better understanding of the newcomer’s perspective, it covers the entire lifecycle when developing and deploying LLMs. Thus, this paper is organized around five core tasks: model compression for local deployment, accelerated pre-training to reduce time-to-train, efficient fine-tuning on custom data, optimized inference under resource constraints, and streamlined data preparation. Rather than focusing on broad strategies, we emphasize specialized techniques tailored to each stage of development. By applying targeted optimizations at each phase, the computational overhead can be reduced by 50–95% without compromising the quality of the model, making LLMs more accessible to researchers and practitioners with limited computational resources. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."

Among these innovations, Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT hold immense potential for instructional design, personalized learning, and administrative efficiency. However, integrating these tools into resource-constrained settings such as Nigeria presents significant challenges, including inadequate infrastructure, digital inequities, and teacher readiness. Despite the growing research on AI adoption, limited studies focus on developing regions, leaving a critical gap in understanding how educators perceive and adopt these technologies. Methods: We adopted a hybrid approach, combining Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to uncover both linear and nonlinear dynamics influencing behavioral intention (BI) of 260 Nigerian in-service teachers regarding ChatGPT after participating in structured training. Key predictors examined include Perceived Ease of Use (PEU), Perceived Usefulness (PUC), Attitude Towards ChatGPT (ATC), Your Colleagues and Your Use of ChatGPT (YCC), Technology Anxiety (TA), Teachers’ Trust in ChatGPT (TTC), and Privacy Issues (PIU). Results: Our PLS-SEM results highlight PUC, TA, YCC, and PEU, in that order of importance, as significant predictors, explaining 15.8% of the variance in BI. Complementing these, ANN analysis identified PEU, ATC, and PUC as the most critical factors, demonstrating substantial predictive accuracy with an RMSE of 0.87. This suggests that while PUC drives adoption, PEU and positive attitudes are foundational in fostering teacher engagement with AI technologies. Conclusion: Our results highlight the need for targeted professional development initiatives to enhance teachers’ digital competencies, reduce technology-related anxiety, and build trust in AI tools like ChatGPT. Our study offers actionable insights for policymakers and educational stakeholders, emphasizing the importance of fostering an inclusive and ethical AI ecosystem.

However, the fast-paced evolution of Android APIs introduces compatibility issues not only in Android apps but also in TPLs as they rely heavily on these Android APIs too. These challenges necessitate continuous updates and compatibility checks to maintain apps as well as TPL's compatibility across Android's diverse ecosystem. Prior research primarily focused on detecting compatibility issues induced by native Android APIs in Android apps falling short in detecting the incompatible APIs associated with TPLs due to the additional layer of abstraction they introduce as well as the obfuscation used by the TPL developers.In this paper, we propose LibCT that leverages a pre-trained Large Language Model (LLM), GPT-4, for detecting incompatible APIs in Android TPLs.

Our multi-stage framework integrates YOLOv8 for product detection in visual media, BLIP3 and OCR for caption generation and text extraction, and multimodal LLMs for product link retrieval. Unified within an interactive user interface, INvadeAI enables seamless product discovery and purchasing, creating a potential new revenue stream for computationally intensive AI systems. We applied a fine-tuned YOLOv8 model trained on 25 custom product classes-achieving mAP@ 50 of 0.535-alongside the base YOLOv8 model's 64 product classes, enabling detection of products across 89 consumer categories. We integrated BLIP3 for image captioning, achieving an average CLIPScore of 0.2852, and utilized advanced LLMs for product link retrieval. While our implementation of LLaMA3 achieved up to 0.97 accuracy in matching products to their purchase sources, ablation studies revealed superior product link retrieval performance when bypassing BLIP3 and OCR integration. This suggests that advanced LLMs can effectively handle multimodal tasks directly. Through our system, we demonstrate a practical application for monetizing advanced AI models by creating value in the e-commerce ecosystem, transforming passive content consumption into revenue-generating opportunities through contextually relevant, non-intrusive product discovery. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."

Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a promising technology for creating more personalized and adaptive mental health chatbots. While LLMs generate responses based on statistical patterns in training data rather than through conscious reasoning, they can be designed to support important psychological processes. Prospection—the ability to envision and plan for future outcomes—represents a transdiagnostic process altered across various mental health conditions that could be effectively targeted through such interventions. We designed “Future Me,” an LLM-powered chatbot designed to facilitate future-oriented thinking and promote goal pursuit using evidence-based interventions including visualization, implementation intentions, and values clarification. Objective: This study aims to understand how users engage with Future Me, evaluate its effectiveness in supporting future-oriented thinking, and assess its acceptability across different populations, with particular attention to postgraduate students’ stress management needs. We also seek to identify design improvements that could enhance the chatbot’s ability to support users’ mental well-being. Methods: In total, 2 complementary studies were conducted. Study 1 (n=20) examined how postgraduate students used Future Me during a single guided session, followed by semistructured interviews. Study 2 (n=14) investigated how postgraduate students interacted with Future Me over a 1-week period, with interviews before and after usage. Both studies analyzed conversation transcripts and interview data using thematic analysis to understand usage patterns, perceived benefits, and limitations. Results: Across both studies, participants primarily engaged with Future Me to discuss career or education goals, personal obstacles, and relationship concerns. Users valued Future Me’s ability to provide clarity around goal-setting (85% of participants), its nonjudgmental nature, and its 24/7 accessibility (58%). Future Me effectively facilitated self-reflection (80%) and offered new perspectives (70%), particularly for broader future-oriented concerns. However, both studies revealed limitations in the chatbot’s ability to provide personalized emotional support during high-stress situations, with participants noting that responses sometimes felt formulaic (50%) or lacked emotional depth. Postgraduate students specifically emphasized the need for greater context awareness during periods of academic stress (58%). Overall, 57% of requests occurred outside office hours, dropping from 40 on day 1 to 12 by day 7. Conclusions: Future Me demonstrates promise as an accessible tool for promoting prospection skills and supporting mental well-being through future-oriented thinking. However, effectiveness appears context-dependent, with prospection techniques more suitable for broader life decisions than acute stress situations. Future development should focus on creating more adaptive systems that can adjust their approach based on the user’s emotional state and immediate needs. Rather than attempting to replicate human therapy entirely, chatbots like Future Me may be most effective when designed as complementary tools within broader support ecosystems, offering immediate guidance while facilitating connections to human support when needed. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."

Effective detection and prevention mechanisms are crucial, and machine learning (ML) techniques provide promising solutions for identifying anomalous API traffic and addressing emerging threats. However, the effectiveness of ML-based security models is limited by the scarcity of realistic, up-to-date datasets and the rapid obsolescence of static training data in the face of evolving attack methodologies. To address these challenges, we present an approach that employs Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate synthetic Web API attack datasets. By leveraging LLMs, researchers can access abundant, customizable, and domain-specific synthetic data that closely simulate contemporary traffic patterns. This eliminates privacy and security concerns associated with real-world datasets and ensures a continuously adaptable data source for training and refining ML-based Intrusion Detection Systems. Ultimately, this strategy enables the development of more resilient ML models capable of effectively countering the dynamic and sophisticated nature of modern Web API threats. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."

Over the past few decades, LiDAR technology has advanced rapidly, significantly promoting research in the field of ecology and geosciences. This paper systematically reviews and explores the potential future developments in LiDAR hardware and algorithms, as well as their applications in ecology and geosciences. We first pointed out that, driven largely by the rapid advancements of autonomous driving technology, LiDAR hardware has demonstrated a trend towards diversification and enhanced precision. Types of near-ground LiDAR platforms have been particularly enriched, enabling efficient and high-resolution data acquisition at unprecedented spatial and temporal scales. Meanwhile, due to the progress of artificial intelligence technologies such as deep learning, Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), and Large Language Model, LiDAR algorithms have also achieved significant development, leading to continuous innovations in point cloud registration, segmentation, classification, and the fusion of point clouds with multi-source data. Regarding LiDAR’s applications in ecology and geosciences, we detailed the applications of LiDAR in 11 research topics of ecology and geosciences: inland topographic mapping, ocean mapping, geological hazard monitoring, forest structure measurement, tree branching networks modeling, 3D radiative transfer and scene reconstruction, forest microclimate simulation, intelligent agriculture, biodiversity monitoring, urban and architectural studies, and planetary survey. Our comprehensive review underscores LiDAR’s versatility and its critical role in advancing both theoretical and applied ecological and geoscience research. Looking ahead, with the continuous advancement of hardware, algorithms, and LiDAR big data, LiDAR will continue to revolutionize research in ecology and geosciences and is poised to play a pivotal role in an even broader range of fields. For instance, combining LiDAR-derived 3D structural information with radiative transfer modeling, computational fluid dynamics, and plant physiology offers the potential to simulate essential biological processes such as photosynthesis, transpiration, and respiration. The advancement of multispectral and hyperspectral LiDAR systems is expected to tackle the challenge in species identification and vegetation trait quantification, opening possible new frontiers in biodiversity and functional ecology. At a broader scale, LiDAR is expected to support the implementation of “Realistic 3D China,”a comprehensive digital twin of the nation’s surface environment. In addition, LiDAR will be increasingly applied to underground remote sensing, power infrastructure inspection, and Earth system monitoring. In terms of big data, the establishment of LiDARNET (https://lidar. pku. edu. cn/[2025-04-14]), a national open-access platform for near-surface LiDAR data, represents a key milestone in enabling data standardization and large-scale collaboration. With the establishment of LiDARNET and other LiDAR data sharing platforms, the availability of high-resolution LiDAR datasets will be continuously augmented, providing critical foundations for the development of next-generation global vegetation dynamic models and enabling more accurate forecasting and management of ecosystem processes at multiple scales. In short, LiDAR is emerging as a pivotal technology in shaping the future of Earth observation, plant ecology, animal ecology, urban ecology, and a range disciplines of geosciences. With the ongoing advancements in hardware design, algorithm development, and high-resolution LiDAR big data, LiDAR is committed to drive transformative breakthroughs across more research fields. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."

In this study, we comprehensively examined the current status and trends in the application of large language models in major blinding chronic ocular diseases such as glaucoma, cataract, and diabetic retinopathy through a systematic scoping review approach. We conducted this review based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extended to characterize the application of large language models in the field of chronic ocular diseases. The study reveals that large language models demonstrate comparable efficacy to experts in disease screening, diagnostic decision-making, personalized precision treatment recommendation, and accessibility of healthcare resources by integrating multimodal clinical data. However, the application of the technology still faces a triple challenge: (1) the limitation of model generalization ability due to the multimodal nature of clinical data; (2) the ethical controversy caused by the insufficient interpretability of algorithms; and (3) the lack of a standardized validation framework. Future directions emphasize the need for specialized model training, multimodal algorithm optimization, the establishment of a multinational multicenter clinical validation platform, and the construction of an ethical framework for dynamic regulation. Large language models are expected to evolve from an assisted decision-making tool to a core component of precision medicine for chronic ocular diseases, and ultimately to achieve an ecosystem of energy-efficient full-cycle management of chronic ocular diseases. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."

Historically, customer service agents working in a contact center used to depend significantly on static scripts and fragmented information systems, which thereby resulted in delayed resolutions, cognitive overload, and made them deliver inconsistent customer experiences. This study explores the paradigm shift that's occurring in contact service centers through implementing Gen AI. Real-time intent recognition, contextual response generation, and personalized engagement across channels are some novel capabilities introduced by Gen AI by adopting Large Language Models (LLMs). Organizations can reduce Average Handling Time (AHT), improve First Contact Resolution (FCR), and enhance Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) scores by integrating Gen AI into core workflows such as issue summarization, behavioral analytics, sentiment tracking, and knowledge retrieval. In order to demonstrate the quantifiable improvements in agent performance and customer engagement, this study adopted a blended research design by combining enterprise case studies, simulation scenarios, and comparative KPI evaluations. Furthermore, it addresses implementation bottlenecks such as onboarding efficiency, multilingual support, emotional intelligence, and real-time guidance. With reference to the industry standards, ethical considerations such as data privacy, algorithmic bias, and explainability are examined. Case examples that are collected from the industry leaders are leveraged to validate the study's conclusions.

Defining clear regulatory strategies for GAI policies is crucial to achieving the objective of information governance in the digital and intelligent era. Furthermore, this is the appropriate role for the country in promoting the governance of cyberspace. Design/methodology/approach: By dissecting the information governance dilemma triggered by GAI content, this paper employs the PMC index model and combines it with the MatLab tool to quantitatively evaluate and analyze the texts of seven GAI policies around the world.

For example, complementors lack standardized, reusable functionality that powers their applications and struggle to consistently generate desired outputs. To identify how complementors mitigate these challenges, we conducted an embedded case study of complementors in the OpenAI platform ecosystem. We identified four value co-creation mechanisms of embedded and stand-alone complements that mitigate the challenges: (1) utilizing system instructions, (2) providing context data, (3) curating user inputs, and (4) revising AI model outputs. Depending on the complement type, complementors employ these mechanisms, leverage synergies between mechanisms, and unlock previously not employable mechanisms. We contribute to research by revealing two novel logics—the reap logic and the differentiation logic—that explain how complementors co-create value by mitigating the challenges through the value co-creation mechanisms. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."

Traditionally, strategic mechanism design in telecommunications has relied on human expertise to craft solutions based on game theory, auction theory, and contract theory. However, the evolving landscape of telecom networks, characterized by increasing abstraction, emerging use cases, and novel value creation opportunities, calls for more adaptive and efficient approaches. We propose leveraging LLMs to automate or semi-automate the process of strategic mechanism design, from intent specification to final formulation. This paradigm shift introduces both semi-automated and fully-automated design pipelines, raising crucial questions about faithfulness to intents, incentive compatibility, algorithmic stability, and the balance between human oversight and artificial intelligence (AI) autonomy. The paper discusses potential frameworks, such as retrievalaugmented generation (RAG)-based systems, to implement LLMdriven mechanism design in communication networks contexts. We examine key challenges, including LLM limitations in capturing domain-specific constraints, ensuring strategy proofness, and integrating with evolving telecom standards.

However, mapping data elements to OMOP concepts demands significant technical expertise and time. While large health care systems often have resources for OMOP conversion, smaller clinical trials and studies frequently lack such support, leaving valuable research data siloed. Objective: This study aims to develop and validate a user-friendly tool that leverages large language models to automate the OMOP conversion process for clinical trials, electronic health records, and registry data. Methods: We developed a 3-tiered semantic matching system using GPT-3 embeddings to transform heterogeneous clinical data to the OMOP Common Data Model. The system processes input terms by generating vector embeddings, computing cosine similarity against precomputed Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics vocabulary embeddings, and ranking potential matches. We validated the system using two independent datasets: (1) a development set of 76 National Institutes of Health Helping to End Addiction Long-term Initiative clinical trial common data elements for chronic pain and opioid use disorders and (2) a separate validation set of electronic health record concepts from the National Institutes of Health National COVID Cohort Collaborative COVID-19 enclave. The architecture combines Unified Medical Language System semantic frameworks with asynchronous processing for efficient concept mapping, made available through an open-source implementation. Results: The system achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.9975 for mapping clinical trial common data element terms. Precision ranged from 0.92 to 0.99 and recall ranged from 0.88 to 0.97 across similarity thresholds from 0.85 to 1.0. In practical application, the tool successfully automated mappings that previously required manual informatics expertise, reducing the technical barriers for research teams to participate in large-scale, data-sharing initiatives. Representative mappings demonstrated high accuracy, such as demographic terms achieving 100% similarity with corresponding Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes concepts. The implementation successfully processes diverse data types through both individual term mapping and batch processing capabilities. Conclusions: Our validated large language model–based tool effectively automates the transformation of clinical data into the OMOP format while maintaining high accuracy. The combination of semantic matching capabilities and a researcher-friendly interface makes data harmonization accessible to smaller research teams without requiring extensive informatics support. This has direct implications for accelerating clinical research data standardization and enabling broader participation in initiatives such as the National Institutes of Health Helping to End Addiction Long-term Initiative Data Ecosystem. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."
