The battery life seems to be pretty impressive so far. After initial charging and leaving the charger plugged in for the first week to condition the battery, I\\'ve unplugged the charger and been using it for twice daily brushing for the last 3 weeks all on the same charge. But the toothbrush head is too small. I’ve seen baby toothbrushes bigger than this one. I wish the head was bigger with different length bristles to get between teeth better because this one doesn’t.  Overall if you can get this one around the $50 mark, it\\'s a good deal. The manufactuer\\'s replacements heads are pretty expensive, but you can get generic ones that\\'re more reasonably priced. This toothbrush makes me feel like I\\'ve been to the dentist every day.

And the 11 piece system went up around $10 or so in price also from the earlier sale price of $29. So it looks okay, but if you look at the base, the part where the blade locks into place doesn’t look as good as in previous editions from a few years ago, but I plan to be very gentle with it (example, I crush very hard items like beans, ice, rice, etc. in the \\\\ \\nblender first then pulverize them in the serving size I want in the blender then switch to the whipping blade for a finer flour, and use the cross cutting blade first when making smoothies, then use the flat blade if I need them finer/less pulpy). Special tip when making smoothies, finely cut and freeze the fruits and vegetables (if using spinach-lightly stew soften the \\\\ \\nspinach then freeze until ready for use-and if making sorbet, use a small to medium sized food processor) \\\\ \\nthat you plan to use that way you can avoid adding so much ice if at all-when making your smoothie. After about a year, the motor was making a funny noise. I called customer service but the warranty expired already, so I had to buy another one. FYI: The overall quality has gone done in these types of products, so they are kind of counting on brand recognition and consumer loyalty to maintain sales. Got it in about two days.\\n```\\n    \"\n",

But the toothbrush head is too small. I’ve seen baby toothbrushes bigger than this one. I wish the head was bigger with different length bristles to get between teeth better because this one doesn’t.  Overall if you can get this one around the $50 mark, it\\'s a good deal. The manufactuer\\'s replacements heads are pretty expensive, but you can get generic ones that\\'re more reasonably priced. This toothbrush makes me feel like I\\'ve been to the dentist every day.

And the 11 piece system went up around $10 or so in price also from the earlier sale price of $29. So it looks okay, but if you look at the base, the part where the blade locks into place doesn’t look as good as in previous editions from a few years ago, but I plan to be very gentle with it (example, I crush very hard items like beans, ice, rice, etc. in the \\\\ \\nblender first then pulverize them in the serving size I want in the blender then switch to the whipping blade for a finer flour, and use the cross cutting blade first when making smoothies, then use the flat blade if I need them finer/less pulpy). Special tip when making smoothies, finely cut and freeze the fruits and vegetables (if using spinach-lightly stew soften the \\\\ \\nspinach then freeze until ready for use-and if making sorbet, use a small to medium sized food processor) \\\\ \\nthat you plan to use that way you can avoid adding so much ice if at all-when making your smoothie. After about a year, the motor was making a funny noise. I called customer service but the warranty expired already, so I had to buy another one. FYI: The overall quality has gone done in these types of products, so they are kind of counting on brand recognition and consumer loyalty to maintain sales. Got it in about two days.\\n```\\n    \"\n",

And the 11 piece system went up around $10 or so in price also from the earlier sale price of $29. So it looks okay, but if you look at the base, the part where the blade locks into place doesn’t look as good as in previous editions from a few years ago, but I plan to be very gentle with it (example, I crush very hard items like beans, ice, rice, etc. in the \\\\ \\nblender first then pulverize them in the serving size I want in the blender then switch to the whipping blade for a finer flour, and use the cross cutting blade first when making smoothies, then use the flat blade if I need them finer/less pulpy). Special tip when making smoothies, finely cut and freeze the fruits and vegetables (if using spinach-lightly stew soften the \\\\ \\nspinach then freeze until ready for use-and if making sorbet, use a small to medium sized food processor) \\\\ \\nthat you plan to use that way you can avoid adding so much ice if at all-when making your smoothie. After about a year, the motor was making a funny noise. I called customer service but the warranty expired already, so I had to buy another one. FYI: The overall quality has gone done in these types of products, so they are kind of counting on brand recognition and consumer loyalty to maintain sales. Got it in about two days.\\n```\\nReview sentiment: negative\\n\"\n",

And the 11 piece system went up around $10 or so in price also from the earlier sale price of $29. So it looks okay, but if you look at the base, the part where the blade locks into place doesn’t look as good as in previous editions from a few years ago, but I plan to be very gentle with it (example, I crush very hard items like beans, ice, rice, etc. in the \\\\ \\nblender first then pulverize them in the serving size I want in the blender then switch to the whipping blade for a finer flour, and use the cross cutting blade first when making smoothies, then use the flat blade if I need them finer/less pulpy). Special tip when making smoothies, finely cut and freeze the fruits and vegetables (if using spinach-lightly stew soften the \\\\ \\nspinach then freeze until ready for use-and if making sorbet, use a small to medium sized food processor) \\\\ \\nthat you plan to use that way you can avoid adding so much ice if at all-when making your smoothie. After about a year, the motor was making a funny noise. I called customer service but the warranty expired already, so I had to buy another one. FYI: The overall quality has gone done in these types of products, so they are kind of counting on brand recognition and consumer loyalty to maintain sales. Got it in about two days.\\n```\\nReview sentiment: negative\\n\"\n",
